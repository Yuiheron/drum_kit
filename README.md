# drum_kit
Developed following Angela Yu's "Full Stack Web Developer" course, I created the functionality (JavaScript) myself.

Instead of using multiple if-else or switch statements to map keys to sounds, I implemented a hashmap for cleaner, more efficient code. The hashmap stores each key as a property, making it easy to look up and play the corresponding sound."
